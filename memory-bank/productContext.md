## Problem Statement

SQL continues to be one of the most widely used languages for database operations, with multiple dialects across different database systems. Developers, database administrators, and data analysts face several challenges when working with SQL:

1. **Cross-Dialect Development**: Code written for one SQL dialect often breaks when moved to another database system
2. **Validation Challenges**: Syntax errors are typically only caught at runtime, causing production issues
3. **IDE Limitations**: Most code editors lack proper SQL intelligence across multiple dialects
4. **Query Analysis**: Understanding complex SQL for optimization or security review is manual and error-prone
5. **Code Generation**: Hand-crafting complex SQL is tedious and inconsistent

Our SQL Parser aims to solve these problems by providing a robust, extensible tool for parsing, analyzing, and transforming SQL across multiple dialects.
