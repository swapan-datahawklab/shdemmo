## Current Focus

The current focus of the project is on enhancing the SQL parser component while maintaining the robust database operation functionality. Key active work items include:

1. **SQL Parser Refinement**
   - Improving PL/SQL block parsing for complex nested structures
   - Enhancing error recovery mechanisms during parsing
   - Optimizing memory usage for large SQL files

2. **Stored Procedure Support Enhancement**
   - Expanding parameter type support for complex data types
   - Adding better validation for stored procedure calls
   - Implementing result set handling improvements

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profiling the parsing process to identify bottlenecks
   - Implementing more efficient string handling during parsing
   - Adding optional batch processing for suitable statement types

## Recent Changes

Recent work on the codebase has involved:

1. **SQL Script Parser Improvements**
   - Added support for nested PL/SQL BEGIN/END blocks
   - Enhanced comment handling to preserve structure
   - Improved string literal detection to avoid false statement boundaries

2. **Command Line Interface Enhancements**
   - Added pre-flight validation mode
   - Implemented explain plan generation
   - Added support for stored procedure parameter passing

3. **Error Handling Updates**
   - Created hierarchical exception system
   - Added error codes for specific error conditions
   - Improved error messages with context information

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. **Testing Expansion**
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for parser edge cases
   - Implement integration tests with actual database systems
   - Develop performance benchmarks for parser operations

2. **Documentation**
   - Complete internal code documentation
   - Create user guide for CLI operations
   - Document SQL dialect-specific features and limitations

3. **Feature Additions**
   - Implement CSV export functionality for query results
   - Add support for additional database types
   - Create basic configuration options for parser behavior

## Active Decisions

Several key decisions are currently being considered:

1. **Parsing Strategy Trade-offs**
   - Evaluating line-by-line vs. complete file parsing for different scenarios
   - Considering impacts of different tokenization approaches on memory usage
   - Assessing error recovery vs. performance trade-offs

2. **API Design Considerations**
   - Determining the right level of abstraction for parser interfaces
   - Evaluating how to expose parser functionality to external callers
   - Considering backward compatibility for future changes

3. **Extension Mechanisms**
   - Designing plugin architecture for dialect support
   - Evaluating extension points for custom validators
   - Considering configuration-driven vs. code-driven extensibility

## Development Constraints

The development is proceeding with these constraints in mind:

1. **Performance Requirements**
   - Parser must handle files up to 100MB with reasonable memory usage
   - CLI operations should complete within acceptable timeframes
   - Large batch operations must remain memory-efficient

2. **Compatibility Requirements**
   - Must support Java 8+ runtime environments
   - Should handle multiple JDBC driver versions
   - Need to maintain consistent behavior across operating systems

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Must handle credentials securely
   - Should prevent SQL injection in dynamic operations
   - Need to ensure proper transaction isolation
